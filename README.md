# Core.Template
This repository is the next evolution in CommonCore; simply called Core.  Instead of using nuget to install the various packets and then manually setting up the project, this repository will provide solution templates that will kick things off.

 - Core.Reference.zip: Contains a blank Solution with a single page and starter files and folders initialized.  
 
 
 (NOTE)  All templates require that you download Xamarin.Forms.Core.zip.  Unzip the file and reference this shared project in all solutions created from templates.
